# Patched Fonts

These fonts are patched fonts from [nerd fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). Patched in the sense that they come with icon libraries that many fonts are missing. This is important to have when using neovim as IDE.

You can install these fonts directory from nerd fonts or clone this repo as starter's kit. To setup

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/
git clone https://github.com/Audiosutras/Patched-Fonts fonts
```

See my [alacritty toml config](https://github.com/Audiosutras/My-Alacritty-Toml-Config) for using these fonts (and their icons!) with alacritty (and secondarily neovim).
